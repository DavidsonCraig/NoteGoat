# Note Goat #
[Note Goat](https://davidsoncraig.github.io/NoteGoat) is a web application that teaches you how to read piano sheet music. Specifically, it helps build the muscle memory required for the fluid reading of sheet music. The application has MIDI support, where you can use a MIDI device to interact with the app. Alternatively, you may use your mouse to click notes on the in-built piano. The application features three main modes.


__Tutorial__
The tutorial slowly introduces the notes within the first octave one by one while also providing the foundation in music theory required to read sheet music.
